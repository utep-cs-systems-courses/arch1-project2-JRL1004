This toy is designed to allow for one to play one of two tunes. To switch
between the tunes, the user should press the button along the long side of the
MSP430. The lights at the bottom of the device will change to reflect which
tune is being played using the following key:
     * No Lights: Off
     * Green Light: Tune 1
     * Red Light: Tune 2
This system operates using interupts and a timer to reduce power usage
